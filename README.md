## Reg. No. 212223240033

# Aim

To demonstrate how prompting techniques such as query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, answer engineering, and tail generation can be applied to create structured content.
For this experiment, the chosen topic is a Report on Stress-Related Interview Questions, Answers, and How AI Helps Overcome Interview Stress.
The goal is to show how different prompts influence the quality, clarity, and organization of the content.

# Procedure
## Step 1 : Introduction to Prompt Patterns

Before generating the content, different prompting techniques were studied:

Prompt Techniques Used

1.Query Decomposition: Break the topic into subtopics → stress interviews, common questions, answers, AI tools.

2.Decision Making: Guide the model to choose the best tone and structure.

3.Answer Engineering: Give instructions for formats like Q&A, lists, and structured report writing.

4.Fact Check List: Ensure HR practices and interview-related information are realistic.

5.Tail Generation: Add deeper explanations and examples.

6.Menu Actions: Provide choices for content style (report, bullet points, formal explanation).

7.Semantic Filtering: Apply a formal and educational tone.

## Step 2 : Choosing the Content Type

For this experiment, the content selected is:

*Educational Report*

### Topic: Stress-Related Interview Questions, Answers, and How AI Tools Help Reduce Interview Stress.

This report explains how stress interviews work, common questions asked, ways to respond, and how modern AI tools help candidates stay prepared and confident.

## Step 3 : Creating the Prompts
Basic Prompt and Output

# Prompt:
“Write a simple explanation on stress interview questions.”

# Output:
Stress interviews are conducted to observe how candidates react under pressure. Interviewers may ask unexpected or challenging questions such as “How do you handle pressure?” or “What if we say you are not good enough for this role?” These questions reveal confidence, communication skills, and stability.

## Step 4 : Refined Prompt and Output (Using Prompt Patterns)
# Prompt:

“Create a detailed educational report on stress-related interview questions using the following structure:

**1.Introduction**

**2.Purpose of Stress Interviews**

**3.Common Stress-Related Interview Questions and Answers**

**4.Psychological Impact**

**5.Role of AI in Reducing Interview Stress**

**6.Results and Insights**

**7.Conclusion — use semantic filtering for a formal tone.**

# Output: Detailed Report
Report: Stress-Related Interview Questions, Answers, and the Role of AI

### 1. Introduction

Stress interviews are intentionally designed to create pressure and evaluate how candidates respond to challenging situations. Employers use this technique to assess emotional stability, decision-making, and communication.

### 2. Purpose of Stress Interviews

• Companies use stress questions to determine:

• How candidates react to unexpected challenges

• Whether they can remain calm under pressure

• Their confidence, attitude, and professionalism

• Their ability to think clearly in stressful scenarios

### 3. Common Stress-Related Interview Questions and Answers (Answer Engineering)

*Q1. “How do you handle pressure?”*
Answer:
“I prioritise tasks, stay organised, and remain calm. Pressure motivates me to manage time efficiently and deliver better results.”

*Q2. “Why should we choose you over other applicants?”*
*Answer:*
“I bring adaptability, strong work ethic, and the ability to stay composed in stressful situations. I continuously improve and learn quickly.”

*Q3. “You seem nervous. Are you sure you can do this job?”*
*Answer:*
“I care about performing well, so a little nervousness is natural. But I am confident in my skills and improve as I engage more.”

*Q4. “What if we say you’re not performing well?”*
*Answer:*
“I would analyse the feedback, identify areas for improvement, and work harder to meet expectations.”

### 4. Psychological Impact (Query Decomposition)

Stress interviews can influence candidates’:

• Confidence: Sudden or harsh questions may cause temporary pressure.

• Focus: High stress may affect clarity of thought.

• Behaviour: Body language, tone, and posture are tested.

• Decision-Making: Responses reveal logical thinking during discomfort.

Understanding these aspects helps employers choose candidates who stay calm under pressure.

### 5. Role of AI in Reducing Interview Stress (Tail Generation)

AI tools help candidates prepare effectively through:

• AI Mock Interview Platforms

• Simulated interviews with stress-based questions

• Real-time feedback on tone, speed, eye contact
Examples: Google Interview Warmup, Yoodli AI, Talocity.

• AI-Based Stress Management Apps

• Breathing exercises and guided relaxation

• Anxiety monitoring and instant support
Examples: Wysa, Calm.

• AI for Answer Preparation

• ChatGPT helps structure answers professionally

• STAR method coaching and personalized suggestions

• AI Communication Trainers

• Improve voice clarity and confidence

• Reduce fear through repeated simulation

• AI improves preparedness, reduces anxiety, and increases interview confidence.

### 6. Results and Insights

• Structured prompts generated clear and professional interview answers.

• Using semantic filtering improved tone and coherence.

• Decision-making prompts helped select the best explanations.

• AI tools were shown to be effective in reducing interview stress through practice and emotional support.

## Step 5 : Further Prompt Refinement (Answer Engineering + Fact Check List)
Prompt:

“Rewrite the above report in a formal academic style with bullet points, accuracy, and clarity.”

# Output:
Formal Report: Stress-Related Interview Questions and AI-Assisted Stress Management
