# Ex.No.10
Content Creation (Reports, Articles, Case Studies, etc.) Using Prompt Patterns

## Date:
## Reg. No.

Aim:

To demonstrate how various prompting techniques (query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, etc.) can be employed to create structured content.
In this experiment, a report is generated on Stress-Related Interview Questions, Answers, and How AI Can Be Used to Overcome Interview Stress.
This highlights how different prompt structures influence quality, clarity, and coherence.

Procedure
1. Introduction to Prompt Patterns

The following patterns were explored:

Query Decomposition: Breaking the topic into smaller units → stress interview questions, answers, stress management, AI tools.

Decision Making: Selecting between multiple answer styles (formal, conversational, short, long).

Answer Engineering: Structuring answers in bullet points, examples, and explanations.

Fact Check List: Ensuring accuracy of interview practices and AI tool uses.

Tail Generation: Extending the report with examples and explanations.

Menu Actions: Providing options for types of content (e.g., report, Q&A, explanation).

Semantic Filter: Adjusting tone to be formal, educational, and presentation-ready.

2. Choosing the Content Type

The selected content type for this experiment is:

✔ Educational Report
Topic: Stress-Related Interview Questions, Answers, and How AI Helps Reduce Interview Stress.

3. Creating the Prompts

The content was generated in stages:

Basic Prompt: “Explain stress interview questions.”

Intermediate Prompt: “Provide common stress interview questions with answers.”

Advanced Prompt: “Generate a structured report and explain how AI tools help overcome interview stress.”

Semantic Filter: “Make it clear, formal, and presentation-friendly.”

Tail Extension: “Add examples and concluding insights.”

4. Generating and Refining Outputs
First Draft – Basic Content (Generated Using Simple Prompts)

Topic: Stress-Related Interview Questions
Stress interviews are designed to test how candidates react under pressure.
Common questions include:

“How do you handle pressure?”

“What would you do if you had multiple deadlines at the same time?”

“Why did you fail in your previous role?”

The answers were simple and general.

Report: Stress-Related Interview Questions, Answers, and How AI Helps Manage Interview Stress
Introduction

Stress interviews are used by employers to assess emotional stability, problem-solving skills, and behaviour under pressure. Candidates are intentionally placed in stressful situations to evaluate their calmness, confidence, and decision-making.

Common Stress-Related Interview Questions and Model Answers
1. “How do you handle pressure?”

Answer:
“I prioritize tasks, stay organised, and break work into manageable parts. I stay calm by focusing on the solution instead of the pressure. In past experiences, planning and time management helped me deliver work even in demanding situations.”

2. “Why should we hire you when many candidates are more qualified?”

Answer:
“I stay composed during challenges, adapt quickly, and consistently learn new skills. My dedication and ability to remain stable under pressure allow me to perform well even in tough situations.”

3. “What would you do if you had multiple deadlines on the same day?”

Answer:
“I would analyse the urgency and impact of each task, communicate priorities with supervisors if needed, and follow a structured approach to complete them efficiently. Staying calm helps maintain productivity.”

4. “Why did you leave your previous job?” (Asked in a harsh tone)

Answer:
“I wanted to explore better opportunities for growth. I believe in maintaining professionalism, and I am grateful for the experiences my previous role provided.”

5. “You seem nervous. Are you sure you can handle this job?”

Answer:
“I care about doing well, so a little nervousness is natural. But I am confident in my abilities and always perform better as the work progresses.”

How AI Can Be Used to Overcome Interview Stress
1. AI-Based Mock Interview Platforms

Tools like Google Interview Warmup, Pramp, Talocity, and Yoodli AI simulate real interview experiences.
They help candidates:

Practice with realistic questions

Reduce fear by repeated exposure

Improve body language and speech clarity

Receive instant feedback

2. AI for Emotional Control & Mental Wellness

Apps like Wysa, Calm, and Mindsera use AI for:

Guided breathing

Stress monitoring

Quick confidence-boosting exercises

Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) style responses

3. AI for Answer Improvement

ChatGPT and similar models help candidates:

Frame professional responses

Improve tone and clarity

Practice STAR method answers

Get corrections for weak points

4. AI Voice and Communication Trainers

AI tools can help improve:

Tone modulation

Eye contact

Fluency

Confidence
This reduces anxiety during real interviews.

Evaluation

Creativity	Examples and answers were meaningful and presentation-friendly
Accuracy	Aligned with real HR stress interview practices
Tone & Style	Formal, clear, and suitable for reports or presentations
Deliverables
✔ First Draft

Simple explanation of stress interviews and basic Q&A.

✔ Refined Content

Detailed report with structured sections and examples.

✔ Multiple Versions

Generated using decision-making prompts, semantic filtering, and tail generation.

✔ Final Version
